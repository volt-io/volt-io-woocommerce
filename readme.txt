Open banking payments are fast gaining traction around the world, but they’re domestic and disparate. In the UK, for example, they run on the Faster Payments rails; in Europe, SEPA or SEPA Instant. Volt has united domestic open banking networks like these to a single standard and point of access. So, in addition to harmonising the open banking payments process, we give merchants the ability to switch on a world of open banking via just one integration.
